![Example of automatic mode using chrome](Chrome.png)  

Allows you to easily identify phishing domains with a marker in the bookmarks bar that changes based off the active origin/domain your currently on.
It can be renamed per origin manually or automatic using the hash of the origin encoded in emoji.

# How to setup
- Add a folder to the bookmarks bar with the ID of the mode like * as the name.
- It will then automatically get renamed.

# How to use
- Rename the folder/marker on the origin or just use Automatic mode.
- When you rename a marker it will not change the mode.

# Automatic mode (ID: *)
It will be different emojis per origin then other users.

# Manual only (ID: **)
Markers will not get a automatic value.
