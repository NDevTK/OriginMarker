# Chrome Extension Security Audit: OriginMarker

## 1. Introduction & Architecture

**Purpose:** The "OriginMarker" Chrome extension provides an origin-dependent marker by changing the title of a designated bookmark to reflect the origin of the currently active tab.

**Main Components:**
*   **`manifest.json`:** Defines permissions, CSP, background service worker, and options UI.
*   **`background.js` (Service Worker):** Core logic for tracking active tabs, fetching origins, generating markers, and updating bookmarks.
*   **`options.html` / `options.js`:** Provides a user interface for extension settings, including a reset function.
*   **`static.js`:** Contains static data like the character sets for marker encoding.

**Key Functionalities:**
*   Dynamically updates a specific bookmark's title based on the current tab's URL origin.
*   Uses SHA-256 hashing with a unique, randomly generated `salt` to create a hash of the origin.
*   Employs a custom `base2base` conversion function to transform the hexadecimal hash output into a more visually distinct emoji-based string for automatic markers.
*   Allows users to set custom string markers for specific origins.
*   Operates in an "auto" mode (emoji markers) or "manual" mode (generic marker unless customized).

## 2. Security Analysis & Findings

### Manifest Configuration
*   **Permissions (`tabs`, `bookmarks`, `storage`):** Deemed appropriate and necessary for the extension's core functionality. No overly broad permissions requested.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   `"extension_pages": "default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content"`
    *   This is a strong CSP, effectively mitigating common web vulnerabilities like XSS on extension pages by restricting script sources to the extension's own files and disallowing inline scripts or external resources. `frame-ancestors 'none'` protects against clickjacking.
*   **Other Security Headers:**
    *   `cross_origin_embedder_policy: { "value": "require-corp" }`
    *   `cross_origin_opener_policy: { "value": "same-origin" }`
    *   These headers are well-configured and enhance protection against cross-origin attacks and speculative execution side-channel attacks.

### Salt Management and Storage
*   **Vulnerability:** The cryptographic `salt` (a UUID generated by `crypto.randomUUID()`) used for hashing origins is stored in `chrome.storage.sync`.
*   **Risk:** If a user's Google account is compromised, or their local Chrome profile data (which caches synced storage) is accessed by malware, the `salt` can be exfiltrated. This is the most significant security weakness identified.

### Initial Bookmark Setup (`onPlaceholder()`)
*   **Vulnerability:** The `onPlaceholder()` function in `background.js`, which is responsible for identifying the primary bookmark the extension will use and its operating mode, listens for generic `chrome.bookmarks.onCreated` or `chrome.bookmarks.onChanged` events.
*   **Risk:** If a user is actively creating or renaming bookmarks during the extension's first run or after a reset, the extension might inadvertently associate itself with an unintended bookmark whose title happens to match the mode specifiers (`*` or `**`). This can lead to incorrect extension behavior (e.g., wrong mode, updating the wrong bookmark) and user confusion.

### Error Handling
*   **Weakness:** Many asynchronous Chrome API calls (e.g., `chrome.bookmarks.update`, `chrome.storage.sync.set`) in `background.js` lack explicit `.catch()` handlers for promise rejections.
*   **Risk:** Unhandled promise rejections can lead to silent failures of operations, inconsistent internal state within the extension, or unexpected behavior from the user's perspective. This is primarily a robustness and reliability issue.

### Marker Encoding (`base2base`)
*   **Note:** The `source` (hexadecimal characters) and `emoji` alphabets used by the `base2base` conversion function are fixed and publicly visible in `static.js`. The SHA-256 hash provides the cryptographic strength; the `base2base` conversion to emoji is purely for obfuscation and visual distinction, not for security.

## 3. Potential Attack Vectors

### Salt Exfiltration and Marker Deanonymization
*   **Scenario:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's `chrome.storage.sync` data (e.g., through malware stealing Chrome profile data, session hijacking, or direct compromise of the user's Google account). The attacker also needs separate access to the user's bookmark data (e.g., if bookmarks are also synced, via another vulnerability, or malware).
*   **Vector:**
    1.  The attacker retrieves the stored `salt` value from the compromised storage.
    2.  The attacker uses the known `source` and `emoji` alphabets (from `static.js`) and replicates the `base2base` logic from `background.js`.
    3.  For any origin of interest, the attacker computes `SHA256(origin + salt)` and then converts the resulting hash to its emoji representation.
    4.  By comparing these generated emoji markers with those in the user's bookmarks, the attacker can identify the actual websites corresponding to the auto-generated markers.
*   **Impact:** Deanonymization of the user's specially marked bookmarks, defeating the extension's primary privacy feature of obfuscating origins.

### `onPlaceholder()` Misconfiguration
*   **Scenario:** A user installs the extension (or resets it) and immediately starts creating/renaming other bookmarks before explicitly setting up the designated marker bookmark.
*   **Vector:** The extension's `onPlaceholder()` function, listening for any bookmark creation/change, might latch onto an unrelated bookmark whose title accidentally triggers a mode setting (e.g., a bookmark titled "**My Tasks**").
*   **Impact:** The extension operates with an incorrect mode or updates an unintended bookmark. This leads to user confusion and the extension not functioning as expected.

### Exploiting Lack of Error Handling (Robustness Issue)
*   **Scenario:** Intermittent failures occur in Chrome API calls (e.g., `chrome.bookmarks.update` fails due to a temporary browser issue or a conflict).
*   **Vector:** The lack of explicit error handling means the extension might not detect or recover from such failures.
*   **Impact:** The extension could enter an inconsistent state (e.g., `active_origin` variable reflects a state not actually saved to the bookmark). This can lead to incorrect markers being displayed or operations failing silently, degrading user trust and potentially misleading the user if the marker shown does not accurately reflect the current origin's status.

## 4. Recommendations & Mitigations

### Salt Management
*   **High Priority: Warn Users:** Clearly inform users in the extension description and options page about the risk associated with `salt` storage in `chrome.storage.sync`. Explain that if their Google account or Chrome profile is compromised, and their bookmark data is also accessed, the privacy of emoji markers can be undone.
*   **Medium Priority: Offer Local Salt Option:** Provide an advanced option for users to store the `salt` in `chrome.storage.local` instead. Clearly explain the trade-off: the salt won't be synced (better protection against Google account compromise), but markers for the same sites will differ across devices, and custom markers won't sync.

### Initial Bookmark Setup
*   **High Priority: Explicit Setup Process:** Modify the `onPlaceholder()` logic. Instead of passive listening, require users to explicitly designate the marker bookmark, for example:
    *   Initiate setup from the options page.
    *   Instruct the user to create/rename a bookmark with a very specific, unique temporary title (e.g., "ORIGIN_MARKER_SETUP_TARGET").
    *   The extension then looks for this specific title.
*   **Medium Priority: User Confirmation:** After a potential bookmark is identified, explicitly ask the user for confirmation (e.g., via a notification or options page dialog) before finalizing its use.

### Error Handling
*   **High Priority: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling:**
    *   Review all asynchronous Chrome API calls (`chrome.bookmarks.*`, `chrome.storage.*`, etc.).
    *   Add `.catch(error => { ... })` handlers to all promise chains.
    *   Log detailed errors to `console.error()` including contextual information to aid debugging.
*   **Medium Priority: State Management on Error:** In critical error handlers, attempt to revert or correct internal state variables to prevent inconsistencies.
*   **Low Priority: User Notifications for Critical Errors:** For user-initiated actions that fail critically (e.g., saving a custom marker), consider using `chrome.notifications` to inform the user, but use sparingly.

### General
*   **Maintain Manifest Security:** Continue to enforce the strong Content Security Policy and other security headers (`cross_origin_embedder_policy`, `cross_origin_opener_policy`) in `manifest.json`.

## 5. Permissions Justification

The extension requests the following permissions, all of which are necessary for its intended operation:

*   **`tabs`:** Required to access the URL of the currently active tab. The extension needs this URL to derive the origin that determines the marker.
*   **`bookmarks`:** Required to:
    *   Potentially create the initial placeholder bookmark (though user-creation is better).
    *   Read the title of the designated bookmark.
    *   Update the title of the designated bookmark with the origin-specific marker.
    *   Listen for changes to the designated bookmark if the user manually edits it to set a custom marker.
*   **`storage`** (implicitly includes `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`): Required to:
    *   Store the ID of the designated bookmark (`local`).
    *   Store the current operational mode (`local`).
    *   Store the cryptographic `salt` (`sync` by default, with a recommendation to offer `local` option).
    *   Store user-defined custom markers for specific origins (`sync`).
