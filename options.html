    <h1>How to Setup OriginMarker</h1>
    <p>To get started, OriginMarker needs you to designate a specific bookmark. The extension will then use this bookmark to display its unique visual markers based on the website you are currently viewing.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Choose or Create a Bookmark:</strong> You can either create a brand new bookmark or pick an existing one that you want OriginMarker to use. This bookmark will effectively become your "OriginMarker display".</li>
      <li><strong>Edit the Bookmark's Name (Title):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>To enable <strong>Automatic Mode</strong> (where OriginMarker shows a unique emoji for each website origin): Change the bookmark's name to exactly <code>*</code> (a single asterisk) and save it.</li>
          <li>To enable <strong>Manual-Only Mode</strong> (where OriginMarker shows a generic marker unless you customize it for a specific site): Change the bookmark's name to exactly <code>**</code> (two asterisks) and save it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Activation:</strong> Once you've saved the bookmark with <code>*</code> or <code>**</code> as its name, OriginMarker will automatically detect it. From then on, this bookmark's title will change to show the marker for the current website's origin.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can find this special bookmark in your bookmarks list or place it on your bookmarks bar for easy visibility. Its title will dynamically update as you browse different websites.</p>
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rename the folder/marker on the origin (empty name to remove) or just
        use Automatic mode. Marker names are saved for that origin unless
        removed.
      </li>
      <li>When you rename a marker it will not change the mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Automatic mode (ID: *)</h1>
    <p>
      It will be different emojis (randomly chosen) per origin than other users.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Emoji Markers:</strong> Please note that the emoji markers generated in automatic mode are for differentiating website origins only. They do not imply any security endorsement, verification, or status of the websites visited.</p>
    <p><strong>Asterisk (*) Suffix:</strong> Markers automatically generated by the extension will have an asterisk (*) at the end (e.g., "ðŸ˜€*"). This suffix indicates that the marker is system-managed. If you manually rename a marker to include an asterisk at the end, it will not be saved as a custom marker for the current origin.</p>
    <h1>Manual only (ID: **)</h1>
    <p>Markers will not get a automatic value.</p>

    <select name="store" id="store">
      <option value="sync">Sync</option>

      <option value="session">Session</option>
    </select>
    <p style="color: #8B0000;"><strong>Storage Area Warning:</strong> Using "Sync" storage is convenient for accessing your markers and settings across devices. However, please be aware that if your Google account is compromised, the unique 'salt' used for generating automatic markers could also be accessed. This might allow someone to identify which websites correspond to your emoji markers if they also have access to your bookmarks. Choosing "Local" storage keeps the salt on this device only, enhancing privacy in such scenarios, but your markers and settings will not be synced.</p>
    <p>Marker bookmark ID and mode are in the Local area.</p>
    <p>
      Extension will rename with a * suffix so they won't get treated as user
      changed.
